# AJAX

[AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp) is a methodology which allows us to communicate between the client and the server through our JavaScript code. We can request information via HTTP from the server using a **GET** request or send data to the server using a **POST** request.

### Types of Requests

Method | a.k.a. | Description
--- | --- | ---
GET | READ | Requests data. This can be tested in the browser.

We'll be adding more request types at a later point.


## Ajax with jQuery

We can call routes from the client side with AJAX!

jQuery has a method called `$.ajax()` (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) which makes creating and controlling these requests easier. Remember, we can make these requests with vanilla JavaScript (see [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)). jQuery just makes it easier.
